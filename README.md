# nighttime_place_recognition
It's a midterm project of CS545 conducted by Mingjie Zeng, Shuwen Liu, and Yang Wu.

The project contains three folders:
- analysis pics : contains all data analysis pics in the experiments
- match compare pics : contains the matching result pics for choosing a proper pipeline
- nighttime place recognition : contains all the .py files and the dataset

In the folder "nighttime place recognition":

Experiment 1:
- feature_analysis.py : this is the program is for experiment 1, analyzing which feature detector can obtain proper and enough features

Experiment 2:
- test_matching_1.py : this is a test program for the pipeline "GFTTDetector_create + SIFT + BF"
- test_matrix_1.py : this is the program for testing the recognition results using confusion matrix for the pipeline "GFTTDetector_create + SIFT + BF"
- train.py : codes to get the threshold to achieve the night-time place recognition goal using the pipeline "GFTTDetector_create + SIFT + BF"

Experiment 3:
- test_matching_2.py : this is a test program for the pipeline "goodFeaturesToTrack + SIFT + BF"
- test_matrix_2.py : this is the program for testing the recognition results using confusion matrix for the pipeline "goodFeaturesToTrack + SIFT + BF"
- sample(500, 1000, 2000).py : codes for generate threshold files(500, 1000, 2000) using the pipeline "goodFeaturesToTrack + SIFT + BF"
- result(500, 1000, 2000).txt : the thresholds get in the sample(500, 1000, 2000).py
- threshold_result.csv : contains the results for for thresholds in each result(500,1000,2000).txt

When running these codes, please make sure your current directory is this folder. 
The values we used as thresholds in test_matrix_1.py is generated by train.py and the values we used as thresholds in test_matrix_2.py is generated by sample(500, 1000, 2000).py.
